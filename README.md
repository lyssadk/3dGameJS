# 3d Game: CosmoCroak

# Overview
The Game I am building is where the player's goal is to go around the map and try to collect coins as fast as possble without running into the enemies. I have always wanted to make a game, and I found threejs and figured this would be a good project to learn more about threejs and make a game.
